All of the station usually have peak streamflow in April EXCEPT Lukachai, which has it's peak streamflow in August. Maybe Lukachai depends more on summer monsoons while the others are more dominated by snowpack.

#### Observations

Mean seasonal monthly discharge shows the expected increase in flow in the summer for Lukachai and Captain Tom was having the higest discharge in the spring. However, this changes when we look at median discharge. This may mean Lukachai's flow is more dominated by Monsoon activity than snowpack.
